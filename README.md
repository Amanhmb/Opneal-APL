About the software upgrade In this program, there is no simple application using Node.js that interacts with OpenAI's API. The goal of this program is to create a web application that can take inputs from the user in the simple interface, and then thanks to these inputs to OpenAI powered by artificial intelligence.

This program will be implemented using Node.js along with Express.js web server that receives inputs from the user and sends them to OpenAI API. After getting the format from OpenAI, the result will be displayed on the computer user's page.

Program Features - **Simple User Interface:** The program provides an interactive web interface where the user can type the written texts.
- **Immediate Response:** The written option from OpenAI is displayed directly on the web page after submitting the input.
- **Integration with OpenAI API:** The artificial intelligence capabilities program provided by OpenAI to create intelligent responses to the entered texts.

The program application uses the Node.js platform to create devices and integrate the API. A server will be set up to listen to user requests, and interact with us using OpenAI API, providing a smooth and interactive experience.

The benefit of the program This program can be used to provide a wide range of practical applications such as sharing, providing readiness, helping users write texts, or even to answer complex questions intelligently.
